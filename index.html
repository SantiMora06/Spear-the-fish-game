      <p id="bicudaText"> The Sphyraena's are a deep water carnivorous fishes, commonly known as barracudas.
         It is the lonely member of the esfirenides. It's dimensions go from 45 to 180cm and it's
         highly aggresive towards humans, and it can attack really quick and go from 0 to 90km/h in 
         a couple of seconds.
         This fish can be seen either close to the surface or about 30 meters deep (4 atmospheres). </p>

          <h1 id="pecesVariados">Viejas, Catalufas y Sargos </h1>
          <p id="fishesText"> The Viejas are the one of the most representatives fishes in the Canary Island coast,
            the same can happen with the Sargos but, in the case of the Alfonsi√±os, is more common to see
            them on the Pacific or Indic ocean.

            Catalufas are really easy to hit fishes in terms of the shot to take, the problem with them
            is that you need to dive from 7 to 30 meter and get under big rocks or "caves" as we call them.
           
            Sargos are extremely scared fishes, to fish them, you need to be fast, agile and make long waits
            over or under rocks to have a good shot.
            As a funny feature of the Viejas, they can swap gender. While the female are beautiful with
            red tones with green and yellow, males tend to have a grey and light grey color.
        
            Just for letting you know, the fishes poop right after swim away from you, besides, some of them are 
            really curious but others are too easy to be scared.
